# customer-churn-analysis
This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset to predict churn, identify key factors affecting monthly charges and churn, and devise strategies for reducing churn and enhancing customer retention for a telecom company.

This project utilizes the Telco Customer Churn dataset to analyze and predict customer churn for a telecom company. With 7,043 observations and 33 variables covering customer demographics, contact details, and services subscribed, I aim to address three key research questions. Firstly, I seek to uncover factors influencing monthly charges, to build an accurate predictive model. Secondly, I aim to identify major factors contributing to customer churn. Finally, utilizing visualization techniques, I delve deeper into the identified variables to formulate effective strategies for reducing churn and enhancing customer retention. Through rigorous analysis and modeling, this project aims to provide actionable insights to help the telecom company improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
